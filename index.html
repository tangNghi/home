			<p> Depending on where we live, we may see them in the night sky. We know of them and we've probably seen a photo of one. From our eyes, they are small, luminous spots dotting the night sky. But just what are they, really? Stars are literally giant balls of gas emitting light held together by its gravity. Approximately 75% of a star's composition is made of hydrogen, with the remaining 24% being helium and the 1% being a mix of several heavier elements. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"> Our universe is home to ten quintillion stars (100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars), and only a few hundred billion are in our galaxy, the Milky Way. A star like the Sun has a lifespan of ten billion years before it uses up all of its fuel and dies. Massive stars may live for a mere million years, while small ones can live for trillions of years. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"> The Sun is far bigger than Earth. 1.3 million Earths can fit inside the Sun! In contrast, the Earth seems tiny compared to the Sun. However, on an astronomical level, the Sun is considered an average-sized star. If you were to compare its size with other super giant stars in our galaxy, you would barely be able to see it. </p>
