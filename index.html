			<h2 id="stars"> WHAT ARE STARS? </h2>
	
			<p> Depending on where we live, we may see stars in the night sky. We know of them and we've probably seen a photo of one. From our eyes, they are small, luminous spots dotting the night sky. But just what are they, really? Stars are literally giant balls of gas emitting light held together by its gravity. Approximately 75% of a star's composition is hydrogen, with the remaining 24% being helium and the 1% being a mix of several heavier elements. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"> Our universe is home to ten quintillion stars (100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars), and only a few hundred billion are in our galaxy, the Milky Way. A star like the Sun has a lifespan of ten billion years before it uses up all of its fuel and dies. Massive stars may live for a mere million years, while small ones can live for trillions of years. </p>
			
			<!--Remember: indent is for actual indented paragraphs-->
			
			<p class="indent"> The Sun is far bigger than Earth. 1.3 million Earths can fit inside the Sun! In contrast, the Earth seems tiny compared to the Sun. However, on an astronomical level, the Sun is considered an average-sized star. If you were to compare its size with other super giant stars in our galaxy, you would barely be able to see it. </p>

			<h3 id="mass"> Mass </h3>
			
			<p> To measure the mass of a celestial object, scientists use solar mass. 1 solar mass = the mass of the Sun. For example, Sirius has a solar mass of 2.02, so it&rsquo;s therefore 2 times more massive than the Sun. </p>
			
			<h3 id="colour"> Colour </h3>
			
			<p> The colour of a star depends on its surface temperature and is indirectly affected by size. When a star expands, its surface area increases. Thus, heat is distributed evenly across the increased surface area, decreasing the surface area&rsquo;s temperature. </p>

			<h3 id="magnitude"> Absolute and Apparent Magnitude </h3>
			
			<p> The luminosity of a star is measured by its absolute and apparent magnitude. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star REALLY is. Apparent magnitude is how bright it appears from Earth, or the distance between the star and Earth. For example, the Sun is so luminous that we can't look at it, while we can look at other stars without damaging our eyes. Most other stars are actually brighter than the Sun, but because they are so far away from us, they don't appear to be that bright. On the other hand, the Sun, which is quite close to us (150,000,000km), appears brilliant. The closest star to us, other than the Sun, is Alpha Centauri A. It&rsquo;s approximately 4.3 light years away from us (40 trillion kilometres). The Sun&rsquo;s apparent magnitude is -27, while its absolute magnitude is 5. The lower the numeric value, the brighter the star is. </p>
			
			<h3 id="nucleosynthesis"> Nucleosynthesis </h3>

			<p> Nucleosynthesis or nuclear fusion is one of the most important functions of a star and is what enables it to stay alive. It is the reason why stars are so hot and bright. The smallest a star can be is 0.08 solar mass. Below that point, nuclear fusion cannot take place. Essentially, it is the combination of nuclei (centres of atoms) to create a different, larger element. When the nuclei combine, it releases an enormous amount of energy. There is always a force of gravity acting on stars, and the more massive a star is, the more gravity acts on it. Nuclear fusion releases an outward motion that counters gravity. All starts begin with fusing hydrogen, the most basic of all elements. Stars that fuse hydrogen into helium are in their main sequence stage. </p>

			<p class="indent"> Nuclear fusion take places in the core of the star, where the temperature and pressure are at its highest. When a star has used up all of its supply of hydrogen, depending on its mass, it may begin to fuse helium. Small stars can only fuse hydrogen. Medium-sized stars like our Sun can fuse up to oxygen and carbon, while massive stars can fuse elements all the way up to iron. This is because the more massive a star is, the greater its internal temperature and pressure. The forces that repel two hydrogen atoms must be overcome, and it takes tremendous pressure and temperature to do so. The heavier an element is, the more pressure and temperature it takes to fuse them together. </p>
