			<h2 id="classification"> CLASSIFICATION OF STARS </h2>
			
			<p> Stars are classified by their spectral type, which indicates their temperature. Each main sequence star (stars that fuse hydrogen into helium) can be classified with one of these letters: O, B, A, F, G, K, L, M, L, T and Y, with O being the hottest and Y being the coolest. There are also 10 numeric values that can be attached: 0-9, with 0 being the hottest and 9 being the coolest. Additionally, the Yerkes Luminosity Classes can also be added. </p>
			
			<img src="Images/classification-of-stars.jpg" alt="Diagram showing type O, B, A, F, G, K and M stars and their characteristics" width="800" height="600">
			
			<p class="indent"> O is the rarest, brightest, hottest type of star, while M is the most common, dimmest and coolest. <a href="#giant-star">Giant stars</a> are stars approaching the end of their lifespan. They have a high radius and become cooler. <a href="#white">White dwarfs</a> are the corpses of small to medium-sized stars after they have died. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"> You may notice that L, T, and Y are not included in the table shown above. These are classifications for <a href="#brown">brown dwarfs</a>, which are failed stars unable to sustain nuclear fusion. Unlike other stars, they are extremely dim and cool.

			<h2 id="birth"> THE BIRTH OF A STAR: PROTOSTARS </h2>
			
			<p> The "empty" space we see in space is not actually empty. These black, empty regions of space hold gas and dust particles. They are attracted to each other by the force of gravity. These particles combine themselves to create molecules, and together, they are referred to as "molecular clouds". You can think of these regions as nurseries for newborn stars. There is enough material (dust and gas) in these nurseries to create thousands of stars alone. </p>

			<p class="indent"> The clouds begin to stir and its particles collide until it forms clumps. These molecular clouds increase in mass, resulting in a stronger gravitational pull and which accelerates the rate of mass accumulated. The clumps rotate and their centre of gravity pulls in more particles which in turn increases mass and rate that it rotates. The innermost parts of the molecular clouds form into a sphere, while the exterior is flattened into a disc. After the course of a million years, the clump will form a dense, hot core called a protostar. It will continue to draw in particles and expand until its temperature reaches about seven million kelvins (seven million Celsius). At this stage, the protostar begins nuclear fusion. Its hydrogen atoms fuse, creating helium. When nuclear fusion takes place, the energy it releases is incredibly powerful. Each star has gravity acting on its centre in an inward motion, and nuclear fusion counters this by releasing energy in an outward direction. However, the output force (gravity) is stronger than the inward force (energy released by nuclear fusion), meaning that the protostar is unstable and is not quite a star yet. The gravity’s force causes the internal temperature to increase. </p>

			<figure>
				<img src="Images/eagle-nebula.jpg" alt="Molecular clouds stretching a diameter of 20 light-years" width="717" height="538">
				<figcaption> This molecular cloud in the Eagle Nebula has a diameter of 20 light-years </figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p class="indent"> To become a star, temperature must be hot enough to support fusion, and ample mass must collapse into the protostar (0.1 solar mass, which is 1/10 of the Sun’s mass). At this point, the protostar will release a jet of gas called a bipolar flow. When the output force is approximately equal to the input force, it will stabilize and move onto its next stage: a main sequence star.  This process could take tens of millions of years. If these requirements are not fulfilled, the protostar will become what’s called a brown dwarf. </p>
			
			<h3 id="brown"> BROWN DWARFS </h3>
			
			<p> Brown dwarfs are not considered stars, because they are essentially failed stars unable to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen. They are, however, able to fuse deuterium, or heavy hydrogen (deuterium is hydrogen with one proton and one neutron, as opposed to regular hydrogen which has one proton and no neutron) into lithium. They are the result of a protostar that did not become hot enough for nuclear fusion to take place and/or was unable to accumulate enough mass. And so, they sit in space, radiating away its heat. In the past years, a brown dwarf with the temperature of cup of coffee was found. </p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="Images/brown-dwarf.jpg" alt="A scale comparing a brown dwarf, which is slightly bigger than Jupiter, to the Sun, a low mass star, and Earth" width="1000" height="739">
				<figcaption> A brown dwarf is slightly bigger than Jupiter and slightly smaller than a red dwarf. </figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<h2 id="main-sequence"> MAIN SEQUENCE STARS </h2>
			
			<p> The main sequence stage accounts for approximately 90% of a star&rsquo;s lifespan. A main sequence star is a star that fuses hydrogen into helium in its core, generating energy that counteracts the force of gravity acting inwards. Thus, main sequence stars are stable. The core will become denser as fusion takes place, because helium is a heavier element than hydrogen. Helium will accumulate until there is no more hydrogen left. However, small <a href="#red">red dwarfs</a> (red dwarfs are 0.075-0.50 solar masses) do not accumulate helium in the core. Consequently, their main sequence stage lasts for a long period of time. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"> When the supply of hydrogen is depleted, the star will begin to fuse helium into carbon if it&rsquo;s massive enough. At this point, it is no longer in its main sequence stage. This is the <a href="#red-giant">red giant stage.</a> </p>
			
			<h2 id="binary"> BINARY STARS </h2>
			
			<p> 4/5 of the stars we observe in the universe are actually 2 or more stars orbiting around one another. We usually find them in pairs of twos, which we call binary stars. In a binary system, the brighter star is called the primary star and classified as A. The dimmer one is referred to as the secondary and classified as B. Binary stars are formed when two protostars are formed near each. </p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="Images/sirius-a-and-b.jpg" alt="A photo showing a binary star system, with the bigger star, Sirius A significantly bigger than its companion, Sirius" width="640" height="360">
				<figcaption> Sirius A and Sirius B are an example of a binary stars </figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<h3 id="wide-binary"> Wide Binaries </h3>
			
			<p> Wide binaries are binary stars that are not significantly impacted by one another because of the distance between them. Because they have little effect on each other, they go through their life cycle as normal stars would do. </p>
			<!--Change h3 to align left-->
			
			<h3 id="close-binary"> Close Binaries </h3>
			
			<p> In close binary systems, the stars are affected by each other. The primary star steals the mass of the secondary star. If their gravitational force is powerful enough, it may even engulf the secondary star. In cases where both stars are super-massive, the primary star will expand. The secondary star will exert gravitational pull onto the outer layers and drain its matter. Because they affect each other to a more significant degree than wide binaries, their life cycle is influenced. </p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="Images/mass-transfer.jpg" alt="A binary star sucking mass from its companion star" width="700" height="432">
				<figcaption> In close binary systems, a star steals the mass from its companion. This is called mass transfer </figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<h3 id="astrometric-binary"> Astrometric Stars </h3>
			
			<p> In astrometric binary systems, one star can be seen while its companion cannot undetectable. This may be because the star is too dim or because the luminosity of the primary star hides it. </p>
			
			<h3 id="eclipsing-binary"> Eclipsing Binaries </h3>
			
			<p> An eclipsing binary is a name given to two companion stars that eclipse. The angle at which they orbit causes one star to move in front of the other star. From Earth, we perceive this as an eclipse (similar to how the moon blocks the Sun during solar eclipses). Eclipsing binaries are not really special. It has more to do with our perception rather than it being a special characteristic. </p>
			
			<img src="Images/eclipsing-binary-stars.jpg" alt="A binary star passing in front of its smaller companion, creating an eclipse" width="616" height="347">
			
			<h3 id="double-star"> Double Stars </h3>
			
			<p> Double stars are fake binary stars. Because of their proximity, they appear to be a binary system, when in reality there&rsquo;re not. </p>
			
			<h3 id="cataclysmic-variable"> Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) </h3>
			
			<p> Cataclysmic variable is a binary system with a <a href="#white">white dwarf</a> (the remnant of a small-medium sized star after it dies) and a normal star. In this system, the white dwarf is the primary star while its companion is the secondary star. White dwarfs are very dense and as a result, have a strong gravitational pull. This gravitational pull sucks mass from the secondary star into the white dwarf. </p>

			<h2 id="red"> RED DWARFS </h2>
			
			<p> Red dwarfs are the most common type of stars found in the galaxy. From Earth, we cannot see them with the naked eye, because they are very dim. They are 7.5-50% the mass of the Sun. Their temperature is cool compared to other stars. A red dwarf&rsquo;s surface temperature can go up to 3,500 degrees Celsius, while the Sun&rsquo;s surface temperature is about 5,500 degrees Celsius. Since they have low surface temperatures, this means that they won&rsquo;t emit so much light. The biggest red dwarfs are only 10% luminous as the Sun, while the tiniest ones shine 1/10,000 as much.  As a result of their small mass, red dwarfs live for a long time. They undergo nuclear fusion at a slow rate, meaning they don&rsquo;t use up their fuel as fast as larger stars do. </p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="images/red-dwarf-percentage.jpg" alt="A picture showing the ratio between red dwarfs and other types of main sequence stars" width="616" height="460"> 
				<figcaption> Red dwarfs are found in abundance as opposed to other main sequence stars </figcaption>
			</figure> 
			
			<p class="indent"> A red dwarf can live for as long as trillions of years. Why do they live for so long? What also distinguishes a red dwarf from other stars is its lack of a radiative zone. The core of a red dwarf is surrounded by the convective zone. When hydrogen is fused into helium, the helium that builds up is spread throughout the red dwarf via the convective zone, and the zone brings in more hydrogen to fuse. However, other stars have a radiative zone surrounding its core instead of a convective zone. As a result, the helium build-up accumulates in the core, and no supply of new hydrogen atoms are brought in. In this way, red dwarfs can sustain nuclear fusion for a long time. </p>
			
			<h2 id="yellow"> YELLOW DWARFS </h2>
			
			<p> Stars on the smaller side of the size spectrum with 0.8-1.2 solar mass are considered yellow dwarfs. This means that our Sun is a yellow dwarf. Their surface temperatures range from 5,000-5700 degrees Celsius. Typically, they live for 10 billion years before becoming a white dwarf. They&rsquo;re brighter than 90% of the stars in the universe, since most stars are dim red or orange dwarfs. </p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="Images/sun.gif" alt="A gif of the Sun flaring" width="426" height="426">
				<figcaption> The Sun is a yellow dwarf </figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p class="indent"> An average yellow dwarf will enter the <a href="#red-giant">red giant stage</a> after 10 billion years before it sheds its outer layer into a planetary nebula while its core collapses into a <a href="#white">white dwarf,</a> which is about the size of Earth. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"> We perceive yellow dwarfs as well, yellow. But did you know that the Sun is actually white? It appears to be yellow as a result of the atmosphere. When blue, green and violet wavelengths pass through Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, they are scattered away, so the Sun is a more reddish colour. If you ever glimpse at the Sun from the corner of your eyes, you may notice that it&rsquo;s sometimes white. This is not a well-known fact, so photos of the Sun are edited to appear orange. Otherwise, we would not be able to recognize that it&rsquo;s the Sun. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"> Another fun fact: the Sun is close to being a perfect-sphere. Most stars are deformed because they rotate at a high speed. Stars like the Sun rotate at a slow rate, so they have a near perfect-sphere shape. </p>
			
			<h2 id="super-giant"> SUPERGIANTS </h2>
			
			<p class="red"> Note: Supergiants and red giants are NOT the same thing. Red giants are a stage of a star, while supergiants are merely massive stars. </p>
			
			<p> Supergiants are the largest stars in the universe with a solar mass of 10+. They&rsquo;re remarkably luminous and shine 30,000 to hundreds of thousands time brighter than the Sun. Super giants live a rather short lifespan. They can live up to a mere 10-50 million years. To compare, the Sun has a lifespan of approximately 9-10 billion years and has already existed for 4.5 billion years, which is half of its lifespan. </p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="Images/rigel.jpg" alt="Rigel, a supergiant star in the night sky" width="900" height="630">
				<figcaption> Rigel, a supergiant and the brightest star in the constellation Orion </figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p class="indent"> Their enormous mass is the reason for their short lifespan. The core of a supergiant is hotter than that of a regular star. Thus, the rate at which fusion occurs is significantly faster. Since supergiants are also far more massive, the gravity acting on it is tremendously strong. Their immense internal heat and pressure allow them to fuse heavier elements beyond hydrogen. In chronological order, these stars fuse hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, neon, silicon, and iron. It cannot fuse any heavier elements beyond iron. Unfortunately, the elements fused becomes increasingly inefficient as well. Fusing 1kg of hydrogen is equal to an output of 650 trillion joules. Fusing 1kg of helium, on the other hand, is only equal to 60 trillion joules. For a star with 25 solar masses, hydrogen fusion can last for 7 million years, while fusing silicon only lasts for 1 day. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"> Eventually, a supergiant&rsquo;s core will be pure iron, and all nuclear fusion will cease. If its solar mass is 8-10, the supergiant will explode into a <a href="#supernova">supernova</a>, leaving behind its core as a dense <a href="#neutron">neutron star</a>. If its mass if greater than 10, it&rsquo;ll also create a supernova while the core becomes a <a href="#black-hole">black hole</a>, an object with a gravitational pull so strong not even light can escape it. </p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="Images/blue-supergiant.jpg" alt="A comparison of the size of the Sun compared to a supergiant. There is a tremendous difference between their sizes" width="568" height="320">
				<figcaption> The Sun is very tiny compared to a supergiant </figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<h2 id="red-giant"> RED GIANTS </h2>
			
			<p> When the supply of hydrogen in a star is exhausted, production of energy ceases. Because there&rsquo;s no energy output, gravity exerts force on the star, compressing it. Since it is getting smaller, this means that pressure will increase. If there is enough pressure and heat in the core, nuclear fusion will begin again in the core, but this time with helium rather than hydrogen. Inside the core, helium fuses into carbon, which releases more energy than hydrogen fusing into helium. This large output of energy (called radiation pressure) causes the outer layers to expand. At this stage, the star is what we call a red giant. </p>
				
			<p class="indent"> Fusion of hydrogen does not completely cease. The core is fusing helium, but in the shells surrounding the core, hydrogen fusion takes place. The mass of red dwarfs is not sufficient enough to undergo the fusion of helium, so their red giant phase is atypical. Generally, they stay in their red giant stage for around a billion years. Their outer layers will then form planetary nebulas while their core becomes a white dwarf. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"> The Sun is what keeps us alive and sustains life, but it may also be what kills us. Assuming human civilization still exists a few billion years later, the Sun When the Sun nears the end of its life, it will swallow up Mercury and Venus, perhaps Earth as well. From our perspective, the Sun will look something like this: </p>
			
			<img src="Images/sun-red-giant.jpg" alt="A manipulated photo showing a city and mountains with the Sun looming very close to Earth" width="900" height="597"> 
			
			<p class="indent"> If we&rsquo;re not scorched alive by the Sun (don&rsquo;t misunderstand, we WILL be scorched alive), this is how it&rsquo;ll appear. Oceans will evaporate. Earth will gradually become molten. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether or not the Sun engulfs us. We will die. </p>
			
			<h2 id="death"> THE DEATH OF A STAR </h2>
			
			<p> The manner that a star dies is dependent on its mass. Small to medium-sized stars will become a <a href="#white">white dwarf,</a> large stars (1.5-3.0 solar masses) will explode into a supernova and turn into a <a href="#neutron">neutron star,</a> while super-massive stars (3+ solar masses) also explode into a supernova before becoming a <a href="#black-hole">black hole.</a> </p>
			
			<h3 id="white"> WHITE DWARFS </h3>
			
			<p> For the average star with an average mass like our Sun, they will become a white dwarf upon their death. Their outer layers will shed, turning into a colourful planetary nebula while its core will stay in space as a white dwarf. The core is extremely hot, reaching temperatures of 100,000 degree Celsius. Despite being only the size of Earth, white dwarfs are immensely dense. They&rsquo;re about 200,000 times denser than Earth. To give you a sense of how dense it is, a teaspoon of material from a white dwarf would weigh 200,000 tons.  Over the course of their lifetime, they will continue to cool down and shrink. Young white dwarfs that have not cooled down quite as much emit X-rays. In general, white dwarfs are composed of primarily carbon and oxygen. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"> A white dwarf can be no larger than 1.4 solar mass. If it exceeds this limit, electron degeneracy can no longer prevent gravity from compressing it into a <a href="#neutron">neutron star</a> or a <a href="#black-hole">black hole</a>. This is called the <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/C/Chandrasekhar+Limit">Chandrasekhar Limit</a>. </p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="images/planetarynebula.jpg" alt="Several different planetary nebulas, which are expanding rings of gases, in various shapes and bright colours" width="750" height="628">

				<figcaption> A white dwarf; the remnant of a small to medium-sized star </figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p class="indent"> White dwarfs don&rsquo;t undergo nuclear fusion, and thus, they are considered a dead star. When gravity acts inwards on white dwarfs, there is no outward force produced by nuclear fusion that counters gravity. Yet, why don&rsquo;t they collapse on themselves? This question had puzzled scientists for years, until they discovered the answer. Because white dwarfs are so dense, its electrons are squeezed and forced to move into a high-energy state, resulting in electron pressure that offsets gravity. This is called <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/E/Electron+Degeneracy+Pressure" target="_blank"> electron degeneracy.</a> </p>
			
			<p class="indent"> White dwarfs will continue to emit radiation. Since it cannot produce any energy and it is losing its energy at the same time, white dwarfs will cool down for hundreds of billions of years, until it becomes a <a href="#black">black dwarf</a> (to give you a sense of how long this will take, the universe is only 13.7 billion years old). If the white dwarf is part of a <a href="#binary">binary system,</a> it&rsquo;ll steal mass from its companion star. </p>		
						
			<h4 id="black"> BLACK DWARFS </h4>
			
			<p> A black dwarf is the result of a <a href="#white"> white dwarf </a> that has completely ceased to emit light and heat. Because they&rsquo;ve stopped radiating light and heat, they&rsquo;re black and practically invisible. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"> No black dwarf currently exists. They are only a theoretical entity conceived by scientists. It takes a very, very long time for white dwarfs to cool down to become a black dwarf (about 10,000,000,000,000,000 years), and the universe is only 13.6 billion years old. </p>

			<h3 id="supernovaib"> SUPERNOVAS </h3>
			
			<p> At the end of a super-massive star&rsquo;s life, their core is pure iron and they can no longer fuse any more elements. However, its out layers are still capable of fusing as they are not pure iron yet. When nuclear fusion starts again in the outer layers, it explodes into a supernova while the core is compressed by the force of gravity. </p>
			
			<p id="indent"> A supernova occurs approximately every 50 years in a galaxy the size of the Milk Way. Only stars with an estimated solar mass of 8+ can explode into a supernova, forming a <a href="#neutron">neutron star</a>. The explosion of a supernova can outshine an entire galaxy, but only momentarily. </p>
			
			<figure>
				<img src="Images/supernova.jpg" alt="Cassiopeia A exploding into a supernova" width="1118" height="819">
				<figcaption> What Cassiopeia A, a star 10,000 light-years away looked when it exploded into a supernova </figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<h3 id="neutron"> NEUTRON STARS </h3>
			
			<p> When massive stars with 8-20 solar masses can no longer support nuclear fusion, they explode and leave an extremely dense neutron star. This explosion lasts momentarily, but shines brighter than one billion suns. They are about 2-3 times the mass of our Sun, but the smallest it can be is 20km in diameter. If their mass was any bigger, then they would collapse into a <a href="#hole"> black hole. </a> They radiate very little light, but the magnetic waves that they create can be up to quadrillion times stronger than the magnetic waves Earth produces. The crust of neutron stars is mostly crystalline iron. On the interior, neutrons stars are made primarily of neutrons. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"> The gravity on neutron stars is so powerful that a single cube of sugar alone would weigh 100 billion tons. If you take piece of a neutron star the volume of a cricket ball, it will weigh 40 trillion tons. </p>
			
			<img src="Images/neutron-star-diagram.jpg" alt="A diagram showing the components of a neutron star and their properties" width="450" height="282">
			
			<h3 id="black-hole"> BLACK HOLES </h3>
			
			<p> When super-massive stars with a solar mass of 20+ runs out of fuel, its outer shell explode into a supernova while gravity acts on its dense core, compressing it into until it collapses under its own weight. A black hole, an infinitely dense point with a gravitational pull that doesn&rsquo;t allow anything to escape, including light. </p>
			
			<p class="indent"> The event horizon is the area around a black hole, and beyond it, there is no point of return. That means that if you&rsquo;re in the event horizon of a black hole, it is impossible to escape at this point. The singularity is the point at which there is infinite density in an indefinite volume. You can think of the singularity as the centre of a black hole. Furthermore, black holes can suck in other objects. </p>
			
			<img src="Images/black-hole.jpg" alt="A depiction of a black hole drawing in mass  from a star" width="800" height="600">
			
			<p class="indent"> Because no light is able to escape black holes, it&rsquo;s difficult for scientists to observe them. We know they exist because of the effect they have on surrounding objects. No one truly understands the enigmatic black hole. Black holes are truly a fascinating subject, and it is one that you should consider <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-58.html" target="_blank">checking out.</a> </p>
